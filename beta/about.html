    <h2>Online Content Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Opinions, advice, statements, offers, or other information or content made available through the Service, are
        those of their respective authors, and should not necessarily be relied upon. Such authors are solely
        responsible for such content.</p>
    <p>We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information on the Site or the Service nor
        do we adopt nor endorse, nor are we responsible for, the accuracy or reliability of any opinion, advice, or
        statement made by other parties. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any User Content that you
        or any other user or third party posts or sends via the Service. Under no circumstances will we be responsible
        for any loss or damage resulting from anyone’s reliance on information or other content posted on the Service,
        or transmitted to users.</p>
    <p>Though we strive to enforce these Terms of Use, you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate or
        objectionable when you use or access the Site or the Service. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to
        monitor the materials posted in the public areas of the Site or the Service or to limit or deny a user’s access
        to the Service or take other appropriate action if a user violates these Terms of Use or engages in any activity

        malicious.</p>
    <p>The Company shall have the right to remove any material that in its sole opinion violates, or is alleged to
        violate, the law or this agreement or which might be offensive, or that might violate the rights, harm, or
        threaten the safety of users or others. Unauthorized use may result in criminal and/or civil prosecution under
        Federal, State and local law. If you become aware of a misuse of our Service or violation of these Terms of
        Use, please contact us at support@virtual-ptu.com.</p>
    <h2>Links to other sites and/or materials</h2>
    <p>As part of the Service, we may provide you with convenient links to third party website(s) (“Third Party Sites”)
        as well as content or items belonging to or originating from third parties (the “Third Party Applications,
        Software or Content”). These links are provided as a courtesy to Service subscribers. We have no control over
        Third Party Sites or Third Party Applications, Software or Content or the promotions, materials, information,
        goods or services available on these Third Party Sites or Third Party Applications, Software or Content. Such
        Third Party Sites and Third Party Applications, Software or Content are not investigated, monitored or checked
        for accuracy, appropriateness, or completeness, and we are not responsible for any Third Party Sites accessed
        through the Site or any Third Party Applications, Software or Content posted on, available through or installed
        from the Site, including the content, accuracy, offensiveness, opinions, reliability, privacy practices or other
        policies of or contained in the Third Party Sites or the Third Party Applications, Software or Content.
        Inclusion of, linking to or permitting the use or installation of any Third Party Site or any Third Party
        Applications, Software or Content does not imply our approval or endorsement. If you decide to leave the Site
        and access the Third Party Sites or to use or install any Third Party Applications, Software or Content, you do
        so at your own risk and you should be aware that our terms and policies, including these Terms of Use, no longer
        govern. You should review the applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of
        any Third Party Site to which you navigate from the Site or relating to any applications you use or install from
        the Third Party Site.</p>
    <h2>Copyright complaints and copyright agent</h2>
    <p>(a) Termination of Repeat Infringer Accounts. We respect the intellectual property rights of others and require
        that users do the same. Honestly, we don't really care about the DMCA (we're not from the US so we don't need
        to)
        but we do care about the Australian Copyright Act of 1968. We may terminate any account that repeatedly
        infringes
        these laws, without notice.</p>
    <p>(b) If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe, in good faith, that any materials provided on
        the Service infringe upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Australian Copyright
        Law
        by sending the following information by email to support@virtual-ptu.com:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The date of your notification,</li>
        <li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorised to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive
            right that is allegedly infringed,
        </li>
        <li>A description of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a
            single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site,
        </li>
        <li>A description of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity
            and information sufficient to enable us to locate such work,
        </li>
        <li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address,
            telephone number, and/or email address,
        </li>
        <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained is not
            authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law, and
        </li>
        <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are
            authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>(c) Counter notices. If you believe that your User Content that has been removed from the Site is not infringing,
        or that you have authorisation from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to
        post and use the content in your User Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following
        information to
        our copyright agent using the contact information set forth above:</p>
